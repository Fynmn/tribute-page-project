                <p id="article-title">The crisis: Rescuing Thailand's cave boys</p>
                <p id="article">During the mission to save 12 boys and their soccer coach from a flooded cave in Thailand, Musk gathered engineers from Tesla, SpaceX, and the Boring Company to create a "kid-size" submarine using rocket parts. The chief of the rescue
                    mission said the device was not practical, and the rescue was completed successfully without Musk's device. A British diver involved in the rescue also called Musk's actions a "PR stunt" and said the submarine had no chance of working
                    in this scenario. In response, Musk called the diver a "pedo guy" in a tweet, which has since been deleted. In September 2018, the diver filed a defamation lawsuit against Musk in California, but Musk has since been cleared. Still,
                    a Thai military official said Musk's submarine could be useful for future missions, and engineers from SpaceX met with members of the Thai Navy to train them on using it. Musk tweeted that the engineers also received feedback from
                    British divers about improving the technology.</p>

                <p id="article-title">The crisis: Flint's lead-contaminated water</p>
                <p id="article">Flint, Michigan, continues to grapple with the effects of a water crisis in which dangerous levels of lead were detected after the state switched the city's water supply (from Lake Huron to the Flint River) in 2014. Residents who got sick
                    reported experiencing skin lesions, depression, and memory loss. The US Environmental Protection Agency says any water with lead levels above 15 parts per billion requires action to minimize exposure. In Flint, lead levels in some
                    homes surpassed 4,000 ppb. Lead levels fell to 12 ppb by the end of 2016, and officials say the water is now safe to drink. Some Flint residents remain skeptical. Musk promised in July 2018 to fix the pipes in homes with water contamination
                    "above FDA levels." He also tweeted that he would organize a weekend to add filters to houses in Flint and to "hopefully fix perception of those that are actually good." In 2018, the Musk Foundation donated $424,000 for laptops for
                    Flint middle schoolers, as well as more than $480,000 to install new filtration systems for water fountains in all Flint schools. In August 2019, Flint schools approved testing of the new filtration systems provided by Musk.</p>

                <p id="article-title">The crisis: Traffic, and the negative health effects of gridlock</p>
                <p id="article">Like many of us, Musk hates sitting in traffic. His solution to the notoriously traffic-clogged freeways in Los Angeles: digging a network of tunnels beneath the city.Traffic is more than just an annoyance. According to a 2014 study, the
                    air pollution generated by traffic can lead to an increase in heart disease and stroke risk for those living near congested areas. Other studies have shown that people living near major roadways in congested cities have an increase
                    in emergency room visits and mortality, among other health effects. Through the Boring Company, Musk is seeking to connect LA's densest neighborhoods with an underground "Loop" system that could carry passengers — and even cars — up
                    to 155 miles-per-hour, cutting travel times across the city, and reducing traffic-caused pollution in the process. </p>

                <p id="article-title">The crisis: California wildfires</p>
                <p id="article">Northern California's Camp Fire is considered the deadliest in the state's history. More than 153,000 acres were burned in the fire and 85 people died. In the midst of the fire in 2018, Musk tweeted that Tesla cars have "hospital grade
                    HEPA filters" and could help transport people in affected areas. Some Tesla owners praised Tesla's filters for helping them breathe more easily, but Musk was also criticized for inserting himself into another crisis, the Mercury News
                    reported at the time. When the fires raged again in 2019, causing power failures throughout California, Musk once again plugged Tesla's products. "Order Tesla Solar + Powerwall battery for 24/7 clean power & no blackouts!" Musk tweeted
                    in October. He included a link to Tesla's website. However, as the Washington Post noted at the time, Tesla's solar setup can keep a home running for only about a day or two during a blackout and cost tens of thousands of dollars.</p>

                <p id="article-title">The crisis: Medical supply shortages related to the coronavirus</p>
                <p id="article">The new coronavirus is continuing to sweep across the US, and new data has shown that hospitals across the country may not be prepared for the pandemic. Respiratory failure is one of the severe side effects of COVID-19, the disease caused
                    by the coronavirus, and ventilators are used to help those patients breathe. But ventilators may be in short supply in the coming weeks and months. Musk has downplayed the severity of the coronavirus, saying repeatedly that he thinks
                    panic over the outbreak is overblown and questioning expert predictions about the disease. He has also falsely claimed that children are "essentially immune" to the virus. On Thursday, however, Musk tweeted that his factories were
                    working on producing ventilators in the case of a shortage. "We're working on ventilators, even though I think there will not be a shortage by the time we can make enough to matter," Musk tweeted. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio
                    told Musk in a tweet that "we need ventilators ASAP" and would reach out directly, to which Musk responded he would talk to de Blasio to "understand potential needs."</p>
